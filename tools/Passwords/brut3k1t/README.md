Crowd-sourced credential stuffing engine built for security professionals.

> NOTE: a full overhaul is in the works to turn this into a comprehensive credential theft framework for red-teams.

## Introduction

__brute__ is a Python-based library framework and engine that enables security professionals to rapidly construct bruteforce / credential stuffing attacks. It features both a 
multi-purpose command-line application (`brute`), and a software library that can be used in tandem to quickly generate standalone module scripts for attack.

### What are some tasks I can do with it?

* Rapidly test publicly leaked credential corpora against multiple services.
* Construct PoC scripts quickly to test rate-limiting for authentication systems.
* Launch an active credential reuse campaign as part of an OSINT profile.

## Features

* __Functional__ - works out-of-the-box with 7 default modules for attacks on both network protocols and web-based services
* __Simple to use__ - launch an attack or implement an attack module in minutes and fewer lines of code!
* __Plugin manager__ - implement your own attack modules, and upload them to the local and global registry, or pull others from the community.
* __Logging facilities__ - incorporate dumped logs into a logging pipeline.

## Usage

`brute` is built for Python 3.7+, and should work with any operating system, preferably macOS/Linux.

To use `brute`, you can either install through `pip`:

```
$ pip install brute-engine --user
```

or build locally:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ex0dus-0x/brute
$ cd brute/
$ python3 setup.py install
```

### CLI Usage

```
usage: brute [-h] [--list_modules] [--add_module ADD_MODULE] [--new_module NEW_MODULE] [-m MODULE] [-u USERNAME] [-w WORDLIST]
             [-a ADDRESS] [-p PORT] [-d DELAY]

crowd-sourced credential stuffing engine

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Module Management:
  --list_modules        List out the currently available modules in the local registry.
  --add_module ADD_MODULE
                        Add a new module to the local registry.
  --new_module NEW_MODULE
                        Given a specifier (type/name), initialize a new module plugin.

Launching an Attack:
  -m MODULE, --module MODULE
                        Provide a valid module to be executed.
  -c COMBO_LIST, --combo_list COMBO_LIST
                        Path or valid URL to combination list (--username and --wordlist will be ignored).
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        Provide a valid username/identifier for module being executed. Can either be a single
                        username, comma-seperated list of users, or a file.
  -w WORDLIST, --wordlist WORDLIST
                        Provide a file path, directory of files, or a HTTP URL to a wordlist.
  -a ADDRESS, --address ADDRESS
                        Provide host address for specified service. Required for certain protocols.
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Provide port for host address for specified service, otherwise default will be used.
  -d DELAY, --delay DELAY
                        Provide the number of seconds the program delays as each password is tried.
  -t TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT
                        Number of seconds to stop bruteforce execution on currently executing user.
```

To interact with the modules in your local registry, you can do the following:

```
# show all modules in registry
$ brute --list_modules

# create a new plugin script
$ brute --new_module web/mysite

# .. edit it with functionality
$ vim mysite.py

# now you can run it normally ...
$ python3 mysite.py --username test --wordlist wordlist.txt

# .. or add it to the registry and use it with the cli
$ brute --add_module mysite.py
$ brute -m mysite --username test --wordlist wordlist.txt
```

You can specify different credential inputs in different formats.

First, you can use multiple usernames, either in a comma-seperated list or a file path. Be
sure to set a timeout with `-t/--timeout` in order to stop an execution on a user after
a finite amount of time. You can also choose to use a URL with a wordlist as well.

```
# with multiple usernames and a URL wordlist, timeout per user of 5 seconds
$ brute -m mysite --username myname,othername,anothername, --wordlist https://example.com/leak.txt -t 5

# with username file and wordlist file, timeout per user of 3 seconds
$ brute -m mysite --username user.txt --wordlist pass.txt -t 3
```

To better automate credential stuffing campaigns, you can use `-c/--combo_list` instead
of the `--username` and `--wordlist` flags, with either a filepath or URL. Be sure that the file
contains a colon-seperated combo per line as so: `user:pass`.

```
# with a file
$ brute -m mysite --combo_list test.txt

# .. or a URL
$ brute -m mysite --combo_list http://example.com/leak.txt
```

### Library

As seen previously, __brute__ enables security engineers to develop their own attacks using the Python API exposed to them. Here is a how a generated template script for a `ProtocolBruteforce` looks:

```bash
$ brute --new_module protocol/mymod
$ vim mymod.py
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
mymod.py

    Module Name:
        mymod

    Author:
        YOU <you@email.com>

    Description:
        DESCRIPTION
"""

import dataclasses

# include any other networking imports needed!

from brute.core.protocol import ProtocolBruteforce

@dataclasses.dataclass
class Mymod(ProtocolBruteforce):
    name = "mymod"

    # replace! you can delete address if you choose to specify through a CLI.
    address = "0.0.0.0"
    port = 00

    @property
    def success(self) -> int:
        return 0

    def init(self):
        """
        Performs the necessary initialzation in order to interact
        with the service. This means creating any client objects,
        setting up the environment, etc.
        """
        pass

    # def sanity(self):

    def brute(self, username, pwd_guess) -> int:
        """
        `brute()` should be implemented to represent how a single
        response against the service would be done. The engine will then
        use this as a callback during the bruteforce execution.
        """
        pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    args = Mymod.parse_args()
    Mymod(
        address=args.address,
        username=args.username,
        wordlist=args.wordlist,
        delay=args.delay,
        port=args.port,
    ).run()
```

Once the attack developer implements the necessary parameters and functionality needed to make their attack work, they can now run it as a standalone script, or bake it into __brute__'s module system for later reuse. This plugin-based architecture makes it deal for attack developers to rapidly build up a script using a simple cookie-cutter template for their use.

If you have any proposed changes, please make a pull request or issue!

brute was designed as a pragmatic approach towards credential stuffing and reuse. In no way does it endorse malicious hacking. Please do not support the use of this code as a method of advancing black-hat activites.
